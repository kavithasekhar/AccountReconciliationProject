Memory management, Multi-threading, Efficiency and Performance:
Used Batching concept and BlockingQueue to meet all of these above factors.
- Grouping configured number of transaction in a batch, put to blocking queue, 
each thread in the thread pool pick up a batch of transactions from the blocking queue
and process to add/update the new/existing account balances
- Online mode can be made horizontally scalable as well by deploying many instances of the application in a cluster mode
- Offline mode is just vertically scalable by means of multi-threading (Limitation)

 - Used JEval and created custom functions for evaluating amount expressions
 - Transaction for single account transaction update
